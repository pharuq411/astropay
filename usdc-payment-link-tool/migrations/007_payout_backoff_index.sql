-- Supports the backoff-aware payout query in queuedPayouts / settle cron.
-- The query filters on (status, last_failure_at) for failed payouts, so a
-- partial index on failed rows avoids a full table scan on every settle run.

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS payouts_failed_backoff_idx
    ON payouts (last_failure_at ASC)
    WHERE status = 'failed';
