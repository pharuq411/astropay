# ASTROpay Rust Backend

This service is the beginning of the backend migration out of Next.js route handlers.

What it currently owns:

- merchant registration, login, logout, and cookie-backed sessions
- invoice creation, listing, detail lookup, and status lookup
- Horizon-backed reconciliation for pending invoices
- webhook-driven payment marking (`/api/webhooks/stellar`)
- a Rust migration runner that reuses the existing SQL migrations

Reconciliation and the Stellar webhook validate each merchant `settlement_public_key` with Stellar strkey decoding before inserting into `payouts`. Invalid keys skip payout queueing (invoice still marked paid) and emit a `payment_events` row with `event_type = payout_skipped_invalid_destination`. Run `cargo test` for strkey coverage.

What is intentionally not faked yet:

- buyer XDR generation/submission for checkout
- merchant settlement cron

Those routes return `501 Not Implemented` in the Rust service until the Stellar transaction logic is ported properly.

## Run locally

```bash
cd rust-backend
cargo run --bin migrate
cargo run
```

The service reads env vars from:

- `rust-backend/.env.local`
- `rust-backend/.env`
- `../usdc-payment-link-tool/.env.local`
- `../usdc-payment-link-tool/.env`
